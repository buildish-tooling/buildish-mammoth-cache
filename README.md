# Apache Buildish Mammoth Cache for Gradle

Apache Buildish Mammoth Cache for Gradle provides secure Gradle wrapper provisioning plus local and distributed cache
management for GitHub Actions today, prepared for Codeberg/Forgejo and GitLab CI in the future.

The shared core is structured so future provider integrations can target GitHub, Codeberg/Forgejo, and GitLab without
rewriting the wrapper, cache, or distributed-delta logic.

Use it in workflows as `apache/buildish-mammoth-cache-gradle/descriptors/github/internal-unreleased-consumer-path@<ref>`.

This Buildish Mammoth Cache family can grow with sibling actions for other build tools over time.

## Usage in GitHub workflows

Until the first public release exists, use a repository ref you control for testing.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v5
  - uses: apache/buildish-mammoth-cache-gradle/descriptors/github/internal-unreleased-consumer-path@<ref>
```

## Runtime and toolchain requirements

- GitHub Action runtime: Node 24
- Local development baseline: Node `24.13.0`
- Expected npm version for repository tooling: `11.6.2`
- Java `21+` for Apache RAT license-header checks

The repository pins these versions so local development, CI, and the published action runtime stay aligned.

For Java installation and switching, we recommend [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/). Install at least Java 21 before running
the RAT checks locally.

## GitHub action configuration

### `config-file`

- Default: unset
- Optional workspace-relative `.json`, `.yml`, or `.yaml` file containing a top-level object.
- Config-file keys use the same kebab-case names as the action inputs.
- Direct action inputs override values loaded from the file.
- `dependent-jobs` and `wrapper-properties-files` may be either strings or arrays in the file.
- `cache-partitions` may be expressed as a native YAML/JSON array in the file instead of a serialized JSON string.
- `github-token` is intentionally rejected in config files; pass secrets directly via action inputs or environment
  variables.
- The resolved file must remain inside the workspace after symlink resolution.

### `base-directory`

- Default: `.`
- Repository-relative base directory for wrapper discovery and other project-relative paths.
- Windows-style relative paths using `\` are accepted and normalized to internal POSIX-style paths.
- Absolute/rooted paths are rejected, including `C:\repo`, `\Windows\System32`, and `\\server\share`.
- Must remain inside the repository workspace.

### `cache-enabled`

- Default: `true`
- Accepted values: `true`, `false`
- Enables or disables cache orchestration.

### `read-only`

- Default: event-dependent
- Accepted values: `true`, `false`
- Defaults to `true` for `pull_request` / `pull_request_target`.
- Defaults to `false` for other events.
- Use this to prevent cache mutation.

### `job-mode`

- Default: `standalone`
- Supported values:
  - `standalone`
  - `distributed-worker`
  - `distributed-aggregator`
- Controls cache coordination behavior.

### `dependent-jobs`

- Default: empty
- Comma- or newline-separated job names.
- Only valid with distributed job modes.

### `cache-key-prefix`

- Default: `buildish-mammoth-gradle-cache-`
- Must start with an alphanumeric character.
- Remaining characters may only be letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, or `-`.

### `cache-key-template`

- Default: unset
- Optional restricted template for cache key generation.
- Supported placeholders:
  - `${cacheKeyPrefix}`
  - `${schemaVersion}`
  - `${partitionFingerprint}`
  - `${javaMajor}`
  - `${runnerOs}`
  - `${runnerArch}`
  - `${refName}`
- Custom templates must include `${partitionFingerprint}` so different cache partition layouts do not share the same
  base cache key.

### `cache-partitions`

- Default: empty
- Optional JSON array of cache partition overrides and custom partitions.
- In `config-file`, this may also be a native YAML/JSON array instead of a serialized string.
- Each object must contain:
  - `id`: lowercase letters, numbers, and `-` only
  - `includes`: array of Gradle-user-home-relative include globs
  - `excludes`: optional array of Gradle-user-home-relative exclude globs
- Overriding a built-in partition replaces its built-in include/exclude lists.
- Setting `includes: []` disables a built-in partition.
- Custom partitions must have at least include one glob.
- Hard safety excludes are always enforced even when a partition is overridden.

### `process-all-wrapper-files`

- Default: `false`
- Accepted values: `true`, `false`
- Scans for every matching wrapper properties file under `base-directory`.
- Cannot be combined with `wrapper-properties-files`.

### `wrapper-properties-glob`

- Default: `**/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
- Repository-relative discovery glob used beneath `base-directory`.
- Windows-style relative paths using `\` are accepted and normalized before evaluation.
- Absolute/rooted paths are rejected, including drive-prefixed, rooted, and UNC paths.

### `wrapper-properties-files`

- Default: empty
- Comma- or newline-separated explicit `gradle-wrapper.properties` files.
- Paths are relative to `base-directory`.
- Windows-style relative paths using `\` are accepted and normalized to internal POSIX-style paths.
- Absolute/rooted paths are rejected, including drive-prefixed, rooted, and UNC paths.
- Entries must be explicit file paths, not globs.

### `cleanup-enabled`

- Default: `true`
- Accepted values: `true`, `false`
- Enables the later cleanup-trigger flow used by cache management.

### `restore-cleanup-mode`

- Default: `none`
- Supported values:
  - `none`
  - `prune-managed`
- `prune-managed` only acts after a base-cache hit.
- It deletes files currently matched by the active managed partitions, then restores the matched base cache again.
- It never deletes files outside the action-managed partition space.
- It is intentionally an opt-in because it is more destructive and may increase restore time.

### `gradle-user-home`

- Default: `$GRADLE_USER_HOME` when set, otherwise `$HOME/.gradle`
- In v1, only the default Gradle user home is supported.
- Non-default values fail validation intentionally.

### `setup-java`

- Default: `false`
- Accepted values: `true`, `false`
- Reserved compatibility flag.
- In v1, setting `true` fails intentionally.
- Run `actions/setup-java` before this action instead.

### `github-token`

- Default: unset
- Optional GitHub token used only for authenticated wrapper JAR downloads against the GitHub API.
- When omitted, the action uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the runner environment if available.
- Helps reduce throttling when fetching `gradle-wrapper.jar` from the Gradle source repository.
- Downloaded wrapper JARs are accepted only after detached-signature and SHA-256 verification.
- Gradle signing keys are pinned in-source as an allowlist so old and new keys can overlap during rotation.
- Never written to summaries or persisted post-action state.

## Cache partitions and restore cleanup

### Built-in partitions

The action resolves the Gradle user home into ordered logical partitions:

- `modules` — dependency artifacts, jars, and resource stores
- `transforms-metadata` — artifact transforms and related metadata; disabled by default
- `kotlin-dsl` — compiled Kotlin DSL scripts and generated Gradle API jars; enabled by default
- `build-cache` — the local Gradle build cache
- `wrapper-dists` — wrapper-downloaded Gradle distributions

See [The Gradle User Home Caches Directory](docs/gradle-cache-contents.md) for more details on what each partition covers.

Built-ins keep a deterministic order. Custom partitions are appended after the active built-ins in the order supplied by
`cache-partitions`.

The resolved partition order plus each partition's include/exclude set is hashed into `partitionFingerprint`, which is
part of the base cache key. Changing the active partition layout therefore produces a different base cache lineage
instead of reusing an incompatible one.

### Include and exclude semantics

- Includes define the files the action manages for a partition.
- Excludes remove files from that partition after includes are matched.
- Overriding a built-in replaces its built-in include/exclude lists.
- Built-in overrides with `includes: []` disable that built-in.
- Custom partitions with `includes: []` are rejected.
- If the same file matches more than one active partition, manifest capture fails instead of guessing an owner.

Hard safety excludes are always applied to every active partition and cannot be removed:

- `**/configuration-cache/**`
- `**/*.lock`
- `caches/*/cc-keystore`
- `caches/journal-1/**`

These exclusions are intentional safety rails for volatile or security-sensitive content.

### Supported glob subset

All partition globs are relative to the supported Gradle user home.

- Absolute paths are rejected.
- `..` traversal is rejected.
- Negated globs are rejected.
- Supported wildcards are:
  - `*` within a single path segment
  - `**` as a whole path segment
- Include globs must end in `/**`.
- Include globs may not use `**` anywhere except the final segment.
- Exclude globs may use `**` as a whole path segment anywhere in the pattern.
- Other glob operators such as `?`, character classes, braces, and extglobs are rejected.

Examples:

- valid include: `caches/*/kotlin-dsl/**`
- valid exclude: `caches/modules-*/metadata-*/**`
- valid exclude: `**/*.lock`
- invalid include: `/home/runner/.gradle/caches/**`
- invalid include: `caches/**/tmp/**`
- invalid exclude: `!caches/foo/**`

### Partition customization example

Use `cache-partitions` as JSON. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "modules",
    "includes": ["caches/modules-*/files-*/**", "caches/jars-*/**"],
    "excludes": ["caches/modules-*/metadata-*/**"]
  },
  {
    "id": "kotlin-dsl",
    "includes": []
  },
  {
    "id": "custom-generated-jars",
    "includes": ["caches/*/generated-gradle-jars/**"],
    "excludes": []
  }
]
```

That example:

- overrides `modules`
- disables the built-in `kotlin-dsl` partition
- adds a custom partition named `custom-generated-jars`
- changes `partitionFingerprint`, so it uses a different base cache key than the default layout

### Restore cleanup behavior

`restore-cleanup-mode=prune-managed` is the safe, narrow cleanup mode supported today.

- It only runs after a base-cache hit.
- It only deletes files currently matched by the active managed partitions.
- After pruning, it restores the matched base cache again before the build starts.
- It does not delete unmanaged files elsewhere in `GRADLE_USER_HOME`.
- If you disable a partition, files from that now-disabled partition are no longer considered action-managed and are
  left untouched.
- If the follow-up restore misses after pruning, the action fails instead of continuing with a partially pruned managed
  cache space.

This is intentionally narrower than “delete everything outside the include patterns” because the action does not own all
of `GRADLE_USER_HOME`, especially on long-lived self-hosted runners.

## Current status

Mammoth Cache for Gradle is under active development.

Implemented today:

- shared `prepare` / `finalize` lifecycle entrypoints and orchestration
- provider-neutral CI/runtime/reporting/storage seams
- Gradle wrapper discovery, static validation, download, and checksum verification
- base cache restore/save orchestration
- distributed worker / aggregator delta exchange, merge, and cleanup
- grouped-log and summary reporting through provider report sinks
- GitHub consumer packaging under `descriptors/github/**` and `dist/github/**`

The remaining portability architecture work is limited to **new provider implementations**, not more shared-core
rewrites:

- Codeberg / Forgejo: validate toolkit/runtime compatibility and add provider-specific adapter/descriptor wiring where
  GitHub reuse is insufficient
- GitLab: add a GitLab-facing runtime/report/cache/artifact implementation around the existing shared
  `prepare` / `finalize` core

Only the GitHub consumer path is implemented and bundled today. For the remaining cross-provider work, see:

- `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- `docs/provider-portability-implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/codeberg-ci-support-evaluation.md`
- `docs/gitlab-ci-support-evaluation.md`

## Incubation status

Apache Buildish is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache
Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
communications, and decision-making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate
that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
