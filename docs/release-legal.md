# GitHub action distribution legal files

This directory holds the legal files for the bundled GitHub Action distribution under `dist/github/`.

The generated distribution files are:

- `legal/github/LICENSE`
- `legal/github/NOTICE`

They are **not** the same as the repository-root `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`, which remain the ASF project legal files.

## Commands

- `npm run release-legal:write` — regenerate `legal/github/LICENSE` and `legal/github/NOTICE`
- `npm run release-legal:check` — verify the generated files and run the full release-preparation legal audit
- `npm run release-legal:check-category-x` — fail if the current bundled action dependency set contains a Category X license
- `make release-legal-check`
- `make release-legal-category-x-check`

`npm run verify`, `make check`, and the regular GitHub CI `check` job now include the Category X gate.

## Generation model

`scripts/release-legal.mjs` builds the action entrypoints with esbuild metadata enabled and inspects the actual bundled npm package inputs.

The script then:

1. starts from the repository-root `LICENSE` / `NOTICE`
2. appends bundled third-party sections in ASF-style distribution format
3. writes the results into `legal/github/`

If there is nothing to append to a generated file, the output is just the repository-root file content.

## Formatting rules

- Use **"bundles"** for dependencies that are only packaged into the action bundle.
- Do **not** say **"includes code"** unless source code is actually copied into this project.
- Group dependencies by source project when they share the same upstream repository / home page.
- Every bundled section must list:
  - npm package IDs (`name@version`)
  - copyright text
  - project home page
  - license link or SPDX-style identifier
- Licenses with attribution requirements (for example, MIT, BSD, ISC) must include the preserved attribution/license text.

## NOTICE handling

`legal/github/NOTICE` only grows when a bundled dependency ships NOTICE content that must be propagated.

If no bundled dependency contributes NOTICE text, `legal/github/NOTICE` is identical to the repository-root `NOTICE`.

## Policy checks

The full release audit fails hard for:

- Category X licenses under Apache release policy
- missing license declarations in bundled npm metadata
- missing attribution text where the bundled license requires it
- missing project home page or copyright metadata

The narrower Category X gate checks only the first item above. It exists so regular CI can reject forbidden licenses immediately without waiting for the broader release-preparation audit to be green.

## Current status

There are no known release-legal blockers in the current bundled dependency set.

`buffers@0.1.1` is handled explicitly in `scripts/release-legal.mjs` because the published npm tarball omits its license declaration even though upstream provenance indicates `MIT/X11`.
