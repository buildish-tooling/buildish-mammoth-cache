# Implementation status and remaining provider architecture

## Purpose

This file is an internal status note for this repository.

It no longer tracks pre-implementation work. Instead, it records the current architecture shape and the remaining
provider-portability work for GitHub, Codeberg/Forgejo, and GitLab.

## Current implementation shape

### Shared core

- `src/bootstrap.ts` initializes configuration, wrapper, cache, and reporting state for both lifecycle phases.
- `src/main-flow.ts` drives the shared `prepare` phase.
- `src/post-flow.ts` drives the shared `finalize` phase.
- `src/entrypoints/cli/prepare.ts` and `src/entrypoints/cli/finalize.ts` are the provider-neutral entrypoints used by
  provider adapters.

### Portability seams already in place

- `src/ci/types.ts`: normalized CI context, execution URLs, host-scoped HTTP headers, and bootstrap diagnostics
- `src/runtime-host/types.ts`: runtime input/state/output/reporting capabilities
- `src/reporting/types.ts`: grouped-log and summary publication surface
- `src/storage/cache.ts`: capability-based base-cache backend seam
- `src/storage/artifacts.ts`: capability-based artifact backend seam

### Implemented behavior

- wrapper discovery, parsing, static validation, download, and checksum verification
- base cache restore/save orchestration
- distributed worker / aggregator delta packaging, upload, download, merge, and cleanup
- grouped-log and summary reporting
- GitHub consumer packaging under `descriptors/github/**` and `dist/github/**`

## Remaining architecture work

No more speculative shared-core refactor is planned on its own.

The next architectural changes should be driven by the first concrete non-GitHub provider mismatch instead of widening
shared abstractions pre-emptively.

### Codeberg / Forgejo

- validate `@actions/core`, `@actions/cache`, `@actions/artifact`, and post-hook behavior on the target runtime
- add a provider adapter under `src/ci/codeberg/**` or `src/ci/forgejo/**`
- add a provider-specific runtime host only if the current GitHub-compatible host cannot be reused safely
- add a provider-specific report sink only if the current GitHub summary/log behavior cannot be reused safely
- add provider-specific cache/artifact backends only where runtime compatibility diverges
- add Codeberg-facing consumer packaging next to the existing GitHub descriptor/bundles

### GitLab

- add a provider adapter under `src/ci/gitlab/**`
- add a GitLab runtime host / state bridge that can drive shared `prepare` / `finalize` execution
- add a GitLab report sink for logs and any generated-file or artifact-based summaries
- add GitLab cache and artifact backends behind the existing storage seams
- widen shared artifact lookup identity only if a real GitLab backend needs more than the current repository/run scope
- add a GitLab-facing runner/package surface around the shared entrypoints

## Architecture rules to preserve

- keep raw provider environment parsing inside `src/ci/<provider>/**`
- keep provider-specific inputs out of shared config normalization
- keep shared lifecycle names `prepare` / `finalize`; provider `main` / `post` naming stays at provider edges only
- keep provider-specific reporting behavior inside report sinks
- extend backend capability metadata before teaching shared flow logic about provider quirks
- preserve existing security constraints: exact-host auth headers, strict artifact/package validation, and no trust of
  provider-controlled filenames or paths
